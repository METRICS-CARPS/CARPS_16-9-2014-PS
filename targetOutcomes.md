## Article ID: 16-9-2014 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Results

> Sample sizes vary among the tests reported because of
missing data. For participants of all racial and ethnic
groups, the order of implicit racial preferences was the
same (Fig. 1). Whites, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics exhibited the most positive associations for their own
racial group. In addition, their implicit evaluations of the
remaining racial groups always placed White people first,
followed by Asian, Black, and then Hispanic people, all
pairwise ts(1467–31,567) > 4.06, all ps < .001, all ds >
0.06, average d = 0.2, except for the comparison between
the Black aggregate and Hispanic aggregate variables
among Asian participants, t(1468) = 0.86, p = .394.
Participants who identified with racial groups other than
the four target groups (e.g., American Indians, Pacific
Islanders) showed the same ordinal pattern, all ts(3291–
3303) > 4.2, all ps < .001, all ds > 0.08, average d = 0.10.

> The Supplemental Material provides t and d values
for implicit evaluations (Table S1)

Note that Table S1 is located in the additional supplementary results document.
